### Hi there and welcome to my GitðŸ‘‹

My name is Nick. I have experience in Python & OOP, working with frameworks like DRF. databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite etc.) and various tools.

I have also worked on front-end with HTML & CSS and Bootstrap. I am actively studying new technologies to get better in this field.

Interesting fact about me: I have taken part in exchange program FLEX and spent a year living and studying in the U. S. which also helped me get Advanced English level.

I believe that programming is more than just bit and bytes and it inspires me to learn something new every day!
